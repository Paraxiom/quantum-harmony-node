## Peer-Reviewed Preprints (December 2025)

### 1. ERLHS: Externally-Regularized Latent Hamiltonian Systems
**DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.17928909](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17928909)

A Hamiltonian framework for coherence-preserving machine intelligence. Introduces manifold structure, coherence functionals, and physically-motivated transition constraints that eliminate prompt injection vulnerabilities and enable stable continual learning.

### 2. Karmonic Mesh: Spectral Consensus on Toroidal Manifolds
**DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.17928991](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17928991)

An O(N log N) distributed consensus protocol using spectral analysis on toroidal topologies. Provides coherence-based node selection with provable complexity bounds.

### 3. Proof of Coherence: QKD-Based Distributed Consensus
**DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.17929054](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17929054)

A consensus mechanism replacing game-theoretic assumptions with quantum key distribution and physics-based validation. Ensures transition integrity across nodes without economic incentive structures.

### 4. Toroidal Tonnetz Harmonic Manifold for Distributed Governance (Defensive Publication)
**DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.17929091](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17929091)

Patent defensive publication establishing prior art for the combination of toroidal Tonnetz topology with ER-LHS energy functionals for coherence-based distributed governance.
